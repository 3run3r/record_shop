# Record Shop

Available on Heroku here: http://recordshop.herokuapp.com/

This is the first project I completed during week 5 of the 16 week CodeClan Software Development course.

It's a simple web app for managing the inventory of a Record Shop. It demonstrates the use of these technologies and languages:

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- HTML
- CSS
- PostgreSQL

I hosted the app on Heroku so I could demonstrate it without the need for someone to go through the whole process of installing and setting up on their local machines.
